git init
git  add .
git commit -m   "yourtext"
git remote add origin  link of  repo
git push origin master
git push -u -f origin master

git remote set-url <REMOTE-NAME> <NEW-URL>

As we've said before, we keep talking about origin throughout this post, but there's nothing preventing you from working with whatever remote names you feel like. So a complete example with origin as the remote name and a URL to a real repo could look like this: 

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/git/git.git

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://[personal-access-token]@github.com/username/repo_name.git
